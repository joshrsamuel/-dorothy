Repo for Dorothy's Book Bonanza!: A game made over the course of a weekend for Horizons 2023.

## Inspiration
The inspiration of our game came from the fact that it's currently women's history month and felt it was an appropriate topic that we could connect to Georgia Tech, especially in relation to the recent announcement of Tech's new art installment honoring women at Georgia Tech. 

## What it does
The pixel-art styled game looks to inform the player of the life and achievements of Dorothy M. Crosland, who was a trailblazer that paved the way for the future of women.

## How we built it
We coded the game in C utilizing a Game Boy Advance emulator called mGBA. Additionally, we used Usenti and Aseprite to create the art for the game. 

## Challenges we ran into
One of the biggest struggles we faced was with the limitations that come with writing a game in a non Object-Oriented programming language, as well as implementing educational features in a video game, as video games are almost always focused on just having fun.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are immensely proud of the pixel-art that we incorporated into the game. Additionally, we're happy that we were able to properly address and balance the intersectionality between education, fun, and difficulty when it comes to the gameplay. 

## What we learned
We learned information about Dorothy M. Crosland when it came to researching her impact on Georgia Tech. We also learned the intricacies of learning a game from scratch, especially when it came to incorporate game mechanics such as the dash function.  

## What's next for Dorothy's Book Bonanza
In the future, we hope to incorporate a soundtrack for the game. We also would love to implement more versatility in the animations of our objects. Lastly, we would want to incorporate the option to play as other significant women at Georgia Tech.
